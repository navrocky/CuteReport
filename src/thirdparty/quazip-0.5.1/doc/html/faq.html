<div class="textblock"><p><a class="anchor" id="faq-non-QIODevice"></a> Q. Is there any way to use <a class="el" href="classQuaZipFile.html" title="A file inside ZIP archive.">QuaZipFile</a> in Qt where you are supposed to use normal (non-zipped) file, but not through QIODevice API?</p>
<p>A. Usually not. For example, if you are passing file name to some database driver (like SQLite), Qt usually just passes this name down to the 3rd-party library, which is usually does not know anything about QIODevice and therefore there is no way to pass <a class="el" href="classQuaZipFile.html" title="A file inside ZIP archive.">QuaZipFile</a> as normal file. However, if we are talking about some place where you pass file name, and then indirectly use QFile to open it, then it is a good idea to make overloaded method, which accepts a QIODevice pointer. Then you would be able to pass <a class="el" href="classQuaZipFile.html" title="A file inside ZIP archive.">QuaZipFile</a> as well as many other nice things such as QBuffer or QProcess.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="faq-zip64"></a> Q. Can QuaZIP handle files larger than 4GB? What about zip64 standard?</p>
<p>A. It isn't supported yet. QuaZIP is a wrapper around minizip. The minizip version QuaZIP was based on didn't support zip64. The newer version that appeared around 2010 reportedly does. But it will take some time and effort to integrate this version with QuaZIP. </p>
